                <p>The Spring Dale School is a school for boys and girls both and not simply a school which welcomes boarders. The schoolâ€™s beautiful seventy acre campus with 
                a vast range of flora, fauna and bird life provide all boys with ample green space and fresh air where they are able to live and learn. It is an environment 
                rarely offered by schools in large and small cities in India, or indeed some other countries. All students are able to seek advice from the teaching staff, the 
                Wellness Centre and the school counsellor living on the school campus throughout the seven day week. Boys discover that they have much more time to study and
                 pursue their wider interests.There is no wasted time travelling to learn Sport, Art, Music, Drama and benefit from 
                Careers Guidance as well as other necessary university and college entrance preparation.      <h4 align="right">Sharad Kumar Rai</h4>
